					<p class=" textone d-flex justify-content-left"> A printer is a hardware device that is wired to scan, copy, and most importantly print information. 
						It accepts text and graphic output from a computer and transfers the information on paper. Through 
						this interface, people are able to access tangible information. The output tray, card reader, 
						MyPrint Brown Printing instructions, MyPrint Brown Printing website, and Print Release Station website are 
						the key components of this specific interface. The output tray physically outputs the printed information, the myPrint 
						instructions direct the user on how to connects the printer to their computer as well as picking your prints, the card reader 
						connects the user MyPrint account to the Print Release Station Website, the MyPrint site allows the user to decide and make any changes 
						to the materials they want to print, and the Print Release Station Website allows the user access to their items on the printing queue. 
						These components are synonymous with each other because the users apply the components purposes to get their printed information.

									<ul class = "interview_responses">
										<li>All of the interviewees printed their items using the MyPrint website. </li> 

										<li>All of the interviewees loved how they can swipe their cards to connect to their MyPrint account to the Print Release Station site and request printing jobs. 
											One interviewee liked how they can upload multiple stuff to be printed. Another interviewee appreciated how they can 
											queue their printing job from anywhere on campus and pick up their papers later. One interviewee also 
											enjoyed how the card reader is attached to the computer table so the card reader doesn’t flop over when they are swiping and how they cancel cards directly.</li>

										<li>There are numerous suggestions that the interviewees proposed about what features of the interface they would remodel. One interviewee wished the website to be transformed 
											from an outdated look to being more heavy in graphics. Likewise, one interviewee also suggested that there should be changes to the MyPrint website 
											for it to be more user-friendly because figuring out how to put their items into their printing queue and then printing it out 
											using the Print Release Station website was challenging for them. Thus, another change that the interviewees proposed was clearer 
											instructions on how to use the MyPrint website to print their items. Another interviewee recommended that the submit printing job button shouldn’t be 
											so small, but instead, it should be the first thing you see and press. </li>

										<li>Most interviewees relayed about how some of their bad experiences with the printer consisted of the hardware device not functioning properly. 
											However, when debriefing the questions, the interviewees express most of their dissatisfaction with using the MyPrint Brown Printing website to print materials. 
											One interviewee didn’t expect there to be a queue and how they had to wait for a long time to print their items. Another interviewee communicated to 
											how having a bunch of subcategories on the MyPrint website confuse them when they had to print their items for the first time. Another interviewee spoke about how slow 
											the process is when printing their items. Lastly, one interviewee spoke about how using the MyPrint website isn’t as intuitive as they would have liked, 
											echoing how the layout of the website and knowing where to specifically click to submit a printing job took some time for them to be familiarized with.</li>

										<li>Some people are frequent users of the interface, printing their items 2x a week. In contrast, there are others who are casual users of the product, 
											printing their items a few times a month.</li>
